			<h1>Buy Heroscape | Renegade Game Studios (Affiliate)</h1>
			<p>For anyone who doesn't know, Heroscape is back! Renegade Game Studios acquired the license for the game from Hasbro and is re-launching a new era of Heroscape, with initial products announced and expected to release/arrive in August 2024.</P>
			<p>On March 12th, 2024 I was approved as an affiliate for Regenage Game Studios' Affiliate Program.</p>
			<p>Essentially, this means I was provided with a link that anyone can use to purchase products from Renegade's website (Heroscape, or any other game) and I receive a 10% commission from any sales using my link.</p>
			<p>My affiliate link : <a target='_blank' href='https://renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c'>https://renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c</a></p>
			<p>EU specific link : <a target='_blank' href='https://eu.renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c'>https://eu.renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c</a></p>
			<p>UK secific link : <a target='_blank' href='https://uk.renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c'>https://uk.renegadegamestudios.com/?rfsn=7890090.4de64c</a></p>
			<p>I know there are several prominent members of the Heroscape community who already have affiliate links in place, all of whom are deserving of support. I hope for this to be one link of many in a (hopefully) ever-growing 'Scape community.</p>
			<p>If you buy new 'Scape, whatever you buy, and wherever you buy it from, Happy 'Scaping!</p>
